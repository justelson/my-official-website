DIGITAL DOPAMINE
THE WORLD WE NOW KNOW

Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems”

THIS IS A LINE FROM THE SIXTY’TH PAGE OF MARK MANSON’S BEST SELLER

This line short but tall in the matter of its depth

Considering the length of this video

And is Among the many things that explain

Why WE HAVE BECOME MORE DEPRESSED AND LONELIER DESPITE QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVING, THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MADE US CONNECTED MORE THAN EVER,

AND WHEN YOU TRY TO WRAP YOU HEAD AROUND THIS IT JUST

DOESN’T MAKE SENSE

But if you really try to think about it the reason is quite simple of course

WE ARE TIRED

And being tired affects how we respond to our environment and nature or else known as

EMOTIONS

To understand this concept and actual know how to fix it lets do a time lapse comparison,

Ok,

The human brain has evolved very little in coarse of the past 300,000 years or so,

But despite that

Man was more primitive than he is today,

AND THIS IS HOW HIS DAY IN LIFE WAS,

AS our primitive man begins his morning lets keep an eye on this part which is the prefrontal cortex

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DESIONS

SO, OUR MAN HERE has some few simple yet crucial decisions to make

Ø Will he spend his day gathering fruits and berries

Ø Or will he go for search of water far a way from his cave

Ø Will he have to go hunt for meat of will he just have to hang out with his fellow band of primitive men

Now checking back on our man’s brain, we still see that he just needs to have the right YET FEW DECISIONS TO MAKE

In a day.......

Ok now let’s check in on THIS MAN’S BRIAN ABOUT 300,000 years later

Not today, but around the 1880’s...

Where when we check on our man’s day, we see that

He wakes up early in the morning and he has to decide what to eat in the morning as he brushes his teeth,

“Well, there is an apple on the table!!!...” (NOT THE BRAND BUT THE SAME KINDA OF FOOD HE USUALLY EATS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THAT WORKS FINE)”

Assuming he lives in Europe he heads to his industrial job, since we know it was the industrial revolution at this time

And because his job is the same and just a repetitive

Again, he doesn’t have to make lots of decisions, just some few more than our PRIMITIVE MAN

Ok,

How does our man do when it’s 2025

He wakes up and........

“Did I sleep well last night?”

“Why does my back ache should I go to the hospital?”

“Did the kids go to school?”

“Is Biden still the president?”

“Let me check my phone...”

“Does my car have enough gas?”

“When is the rent due”

“When should I file the boss’ paperwork”

“What will I wear today?”

“What will I eat?”

“Should I text back to my co-worker?”

“I think I should start my business?”

“Did I miss anything on Instagram, YouTube, tik Tok...”

“Should I cancel my Adobe subscription?”

“Did the kids Finish their homework?”

“I think I should get new shoes those don’t match”

Etc. Etc.

Its still 7am in the morning,

And he has made a ton of decisions.

And when we check the prefrontal cortex,

Its a mess up there.

We make this too many decisions of which most of them are high stakes and really important.

And this eventually tires our brains of which have changed much compared to when we use to only think about hunting, collecting berries or working one single job every single day

All of this happens despite the invention of the machines which would eventually make our lives easier

The dish washer,

the microwave,

the car,

the laundry machine

BUT WAIT THERE IS ONE MORE,

THE PHONE........

How many times have checked your WhatsApp before watching thing this video....

Assuming that you are anormal person statistically speaking you spend around 16 hours and 52 minutes on WhatsApp per month

1MINUTE PER SESSION

That’s 9 days of you using WhatsApp per year

That’s if you a normal WhatsApp user SOURCE :STATISTA https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294880/time-spent-whatsapp-app-selected-countries/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20users%20worldwide%20spent,hours%20monthly%20on%20the%20app.

And I haven’t yet included other social media apps in the pot

YOUTUBE ;7 MINUTES PER SESSION ;46 MINUTES A DAY (14 DAYS A YEAR)

TIKTOK;6MINUTES PER SESSION; 38 MINUTES A Day (17 days a year)

When the phone was being released back IN March 7, 1876 WHEN THEY WERE FIRST RELEASED

THE HOPES WERE THAT THE PHONE COULD BE USED FOR

Ø Connecting people

Ø Finding news

Ø Connecting businesses

Ø Spreading causes

Ø Growing business

But the story is different


When people are asked, around 37.5% of people have the primary reason to fill the spare time they have,

Every one in the internets seeks validation to feel good about themselves

Tik Toks and shorts have become more addictive than ever

Brain rot content is at it all time high

The concept of the iPad kids isn’t a myth anymore it true and its scary

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ADVERTISERS ARE THE MASTERS AND YOU ARE THE PUPPET

And THIS IS HOW YOU CAN BREAK FREE FROM THESE CHAINS OF MANIPULATION ONCE AND FOR ALL

First let’s try to understand this whole addiction thing

Remember the PRE FRONTAL CORTEX

Yeah, that was a waste of time

Just joking,

The main reason I introduced that is to ask you when is the last time you got to go to sleep

Without checking one last time if some body texted you

Without checking if some influencer you follow hasn’t posted

Some person hasn’t like you photo

WHEN....

And is it bad thing to do

Its just checking something I like

Just checking if I have any followers

What’s the big deal?

Well, I certainly agree with you

Because fact is that you are watching this video through a social media platform

But let’s look at it from a moral perspective as described

By among the greatest philosophers in my opinion


IMMANUEL KANT

He briefly says that for something to become right it had to be universal

It can’t be that it good somewhere and its bad somewhere else

And if that is so that thing which is goodish baddish is basically morally untechnical

He also states that

IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ONE USE HUMANITY AS MEANS TO CERTAIN END, THE END BEING A SELFISH DESIRE

Ok, lets back off al little bit and explain what this means

This means that you should not use others as a means to and end product of your choice

For example, I to get a Starbucks I have to drive to get there and actually get it

In this situation the car is the means the coffee is the end

Or you call a friend to know how they are doing

The phone is the means knowing how they re doing is the end

BUT the means get as deep as real purpose the end is suppose to be

For example, I go to get coffee just to make my friend happy

Here the whole structure changes

The end or the purpose now becomes making my friend happy

And the means to make him happy is by driving, getting the coffee which will at the end make him happy

Or, I go and get coffee for my friend to become happy so that I can later get some money out of him

And sure, I might sound like a dirt bag but this is what KANT is trying to tell

That,

a. Using a rational being as a means for self need or desire in morally unethical

b. Every thing and every action that you do isn’t just done it doesn’t just appear

You do it because that action is part of a means with a greater end

And this come because humans are the rational meaning they can think, plan, analyse, and act

The reason why I used the term rational being is because even using your self as means is morally unethical

But elson

How the heck can I use my self as a means

AND THIS IS WHERE I FINALLY INTRODUCE ADDICTIONS

An addiction

Is when you have a strong physical or psychological need or urge to do something or use something.

And the whole point of an addictions is to use yourself as a means for the emotion uplift as an end

And now that you understand why an addiction is morally unethical

Let’s see the reason why

ADDICTIONS ARE SO ADDICTIVE

Addictions are not just a brain glitch but an evolutionary character

Remember our primitive man, yeah that one

Addictions were his reason to survive because it gave him pleasure

But why?

When man went hunting, he knew that he had to do it because of his pleasures

Like his mate, food, his gang

That’s why humans are rational

And this character of wanting and satisfaction

Made him to have the pleasure of longer survival

That’s why we have medicine

And this wanting of pleasure also made man want to make easy for himself to gain pleasure

That’s in modern day and age

The things that are the easiest to get are pleasure factors such as ordering junk food in a matter of a few clicks

Being able to satisfy your self to satisfy yourself with watching REELS and corn

Its not because its just addictive

its our evolutionary character

But elson mgaya

if its our evolutionary character, why should we avoid it

Good question

Its because the evolutionary character itself is part of a bigger means

Yes, and the end of this means is EMOTIONAL SATISFACTION

That’s why you are addicted to social media

Even though you know its bad

You are the means to fill your brain with DOPAMINE

And make yourself think that you feel good while actually

You’re poisoning your brain with something that is needed at very small amounts

And the reason why you can’t stop is because the emotional satisfaction doesn’t care

About its ease or effects

It will crave for them and do any thing so that it could eventually get them

BUT THIS INFLUENCE OF OUR BRAIN TO GET THESE PLESURES IS NOT BUILT FOR US

Since, the brain as I said is very much the same as just like the primitive man was

That’s why we struggle, we get depressed and have anxiety

And the baseline of all of this is something called dopamine

DOPAMINE

By definition

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that acts on areas of the brain to give you feelings of pleasure, satisfaction and motivation

And its influence on your mind is more complex than you think

The reason why this hormone is activated is it needs to fill in the blankness of emotions these are triggers

For example, when you feel angry or sad you brain often feels that this kind of situations is not normal or unusual this is a trigger

Therefore, under the influence of dopamine the brain is influenced to anticipate that when I open up Reels, I will feel better

This is when the brain starts to allow the flow of dopamine

Because it anticipates that

if SCROLLING MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ONCE IT CAN DO IT AGAIN

if DRINKING MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ONCE IT CAN DO IT AGAIN

if GAMING MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ONCE IT CAN DO IT AGAIN

if WATCHING CORN MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ONCE IT CAN DO IT AGAIN

if TAKING DRUGS MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ONCE IT CAN DO IT AGAIN

These triggers are dopamine rushes

IT SIMPLY LIKE THAT

Dopamine is not a feel-good hormone

ON THE CONTRARY AN ANTICIPATION

It influences the brain to feel that if a certain thing is done and made you feel better it can do it again

And this kind of feeling comes when you are DEPRESSED, SAD OR ANXIOUS

THATS WHY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS HORMONE IN THIS DAY AND AGE

Because there has never been such a big influx and influence of it in our minds

And makes us want to come back for things again and again

And makes us more and more depressed

That’s how positive works but the are kind of different

The action is the one that triggers the dopamine not the anticipation of it

When we eat healthy our brains have very much low anticipation over it until you get the results of great health and immunity

IN SHORT BAD HABITS ARE THE ONES TRIGGERED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CONSTRAINTS WHILE GOOD HABITS ARE TRIGGERED INTERNALLY AND BUILT OVER THE LONGTIME SENCE OF INTRNAL REWARD

BUT THESE ADDICTIONS HAVE A GUNIUEN REASON TO THERE

SINCE

If you really understood the logic, you would know that the reason addiction exists its because

The fill in the gap in emotions which are influenced by their environment

PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CHAOS AND TROUBLE OR AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES THEM FEEL LONELY AND UNSAFE

Are the ones who are more likely to have severe addictions to certain things

Even if they feel good, they will still feel good because it gives them a reason for survival

That’s why it is a must for addictions to not be taken for treatment

But to be taken for therapy

Addictions don’t just disappear they are taken to remission

We can certainly control our actions

But we cannot re write the happy memories we had while eating sugars or playing video games

But in therapy we should always remember why our addictions differ

This is because it traces back up to our genetics

YES, HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY SOME ARE ADDICTED TO DRINKING AND SOME ARE NOT?

It contributing factor is genetics

I am not saying that someone will come straight out of the womb craving for a bottle

No but genetics are used to determine if we will be addicted to somethings than others

For example, the addiction of alcohol is far more complex than it looks in its outer shell

When one drinks alcohol, it makes them feel better and euphoric

And that’s where the ADH1B comes to play

This breaks down ethanol alcohol to ACETALDEHYDE

A highly toxic substance that causes headaches, nausea and hangovers

BUT THE BODY TRIES TO NEUTROLIZE IT QUCKLY

Which is the job of the gene ALDH2

THE AVERAGE PERSON MIGHT NOT FEEL THE EFFECT OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL

BUT IF THE GENE VARIATIONS WORK SLOWER THAN NORMAL

A PERSON MAY BARELY FEEL THE FEELING OF INTOXICATION AFTER TAKING IT AND THUS MAKING THAT PERSON HAVE HIGH TORELANCE AN ND ADDICTION TO IT

AND THE VICE VERSA IS TRUE

IF A PERSONS GENE VARIATIONS ARE DELAYED THE FEELING OF INTOXICATION IS FAR MORE LIKELY

AND THATS WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE LOWER ALCOHOL TORELANCE AND OTHERS ARE MORE ADDICTED TO IT

AND just like the way this works in alcohol

Other addictions work the same way but with less more science and more emotional stuff

Just with the dopamine components like DRD2 or DRD4 which influence the sense of joy when anticipating doing something

And all of this science is hard to handle

But makes you understand that bad habits and addictions

Are often hard things which aren’t as easy as not doing them

It takes time and the right approach they can be taken to remission

Don’t just snatch away an iPad from a kid

Understanding why they are addicted to it and manipulating it to build a good habit

Of which this leads us to the most important,

Question

Elson how can we get rid of addictions and build better habits

Well, I could just tell you go and buy and read the book of

Atomic habits which is the book that led me to endless rabbit holes of searching for all of this information

Which by the way took along time to prepare and really, I never told anyone about it

Because I knew to understand the value of this information is hard until now

So please subscribe since that really helps out and supports and pushes me to make more generous and detailed content

And by the way, shout out to ALBERT who made another video about addictions which really made me and you understand alcohol better than we did

So, any way you can check out the book of atomic habits which is linked in the description which is indeed well detailed

About how to build and destroy good or bad habits of which is the first point in making a good habit and breaking your addictions

Making a good habit is all about 4 steps which should all be followed well

Since the main structure of building habits works like this

- Any habit looks neutral and not defined at all unless you know it or have passed through it

Habits follow this structure

- They cue which is the trigger to a certain action this time lets use WATCHING REELS which is triggered by the cue of being sad or depressed

- Then the craving or anticipation THIS IS WHERE THE DOPAMINE KICKS IN essentially what happens you start anticipating or wanting it since you know it feels good

- Then follows the response which is basically the actions you do to fulfil that anticipation

- And finally, the reward this is that feel good feeling of which you are rewarded and in turn you feel good about it which will make you want more

Now let’s insert this into our habits book of addictions

For addictions this works like this

First, the trigger of the of the addiction becomes OBVIOUS of which our trigger suggest that people in sad, depressed and tough times are more likely to have this kind of addictions which are bad like alcohol and sugary foods

Second, when the trigger becomes too strong to resist, we now have the feeling of wanting the addiction since we know that the mind and the body will be happy or we will feel euphoric right after we have obtained that addiction

Third, now its that time when we actually do it, we eat sugar, scroll for endless hours as in this moment the dopamine rush is at its peak especially for the first time

Fourth, the feeling of satisfaction kicks in and you feel good and satisfied after obtaining what you wanted but the fact of knowing that what you have done is bad just makes you feel guilty but you forget this and the next time the trigger kicks in the cycle repeats and it never ends

So, from this logic we understand that the way this works is just in a cycle started by triggers which could be avoided by keeping your self happy, showing self respect and being in an agreement with your self by keeping your self busy because an idle mind is devil's work shop The idleness in your mind lets your mind wonder to satisfy its craving sometimes even when the trigger is not present

Pick a skill to learn and make money out of it or give it you're all keeping your mind active and making yourself happy by doing something that you love

That's two, three ...... Yeah, THATS ABOUT IT JUST go get therapy, Coz letting an addiction or some thing go is tough because the one thing that people don't understand about our individualized, weird, dark, creepy addictions is that it is hard to quit an addiction because

AN ADDICTION IS NOT ABOUT THE THING WE WANT, ITS ABOUT THE HAPPY MEMORIES THAT COME WITH IT.......
